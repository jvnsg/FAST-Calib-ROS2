# FAST-Calib ROS2

Based on [engine1wu](https://github.com/hku-mars/FAST-Calib/issues/35)'s work, this is a port of the ROS1 FAST-Calib project to ROS2. Tested on Ubuntu 22.04 Humble only.

## Usage
### Parameter Configuration
Test data is provided in `calib_data/mid360_11`, converted from the `mid360/11` point cloud in the [sample data](https://connecthkuhk-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/zhengcr_connect_hku_hk/Eq_k_4Mf_11Eggg4a5lbRzgBHwd0EivtCJd2ExtcNlu1FA?e=vjm4gH) to ROS2 bag format. To run this test dataset, update the path parameters in `config/qr_params.yaml`. Note that `bag_path` must point to the folder containing the *ROS2 bag PointCloud2* recording.

### Launch Node
```bash
ros2 launch fast_calib calib.launch.py
```


# FAST-Calib
FAST-Calib is an automatic target-based extrinsic calibration tool for LiDAR-camera systems (eg., [FAST-LIVO2](https://github.com/hku-mars/FAST-LIVO2)). 

**Key highlights include:** 

1. Support solid-state and mechanical LiDAR.
2. No need for any initial extrinsic parameters.
3. Achieve highly accurate calibration results **in just 2 seconds**.

**In short, it makes extrinsic calibration as simple as intrinsic calibration.**

## 1. Prerequisites
PCL>=1.8, OpenCV>=4.0.

## 2. Run our examples
1. Prepare the static acquisition data in `calib_data` folder (see [sample data](https://connecthkuhk-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/zhengcr_connect_hku_hk/Eq_k_4Mf_11Eggg4a5lbRzgBHwd0EivtCJd2ExtcNlu1FA?e=vjm4gH) from Mid360, Avia and Ouster):
- rosbag containing point cloud messages
- corresponding image

2. Run the calibration process:
```bash
roslaunch fast_calib calib.launch
```

## 3. Run on your own sensor suite
1. Customize the calibration target in the image below.
2. Record data to rosbag.
3. Provide the instrinsic matrix in `qr_params.yaml`.
4. Set distance filter in `qr_params.yaml` for board point cloud (extra points are acceptable).
5. Calibrate now!
